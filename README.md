# Interviews

These are interview questions to consider asking when interviewing folks that may be joining your team, or to prepare yourself if you're being interviewed for a role yourself.

## Questions

1. What’s the hardest problem you solved? How did you solve it?
    * _This question gives you a better idea of how they work and what level they are at by knowing what they think a hard problem is._
2. What problem were you unable to solve?
3. What are your favorite technologies? Why?
4. What don’t you like about those favorite technologies?
    * _If you know a technology really well, you’ll know where its shortcomings are._
5. Do you have any source code that I can look at?
    * _This assumes that the person has time for open source work. This is not always the case for many people; don’t fault them if they don’t have code available for you to look at._
    * _However, this is self-selecting so they can show you their best. It can provide an extra pro or con with their actual work if you can see it._
6. What is your development process? For example, do you follow test driven development (TDD) or something else?
7. What is your experience with agile, scrum, or kanban?
8. Have you developed code as pair developers, or alone? Trunk development or branches? What’s your favorite and why?
9. What is your experience with DevOps and CI/CD?
10. Have you ever worked remotely before or been with a remote-first team? How do you ensure good collaboration while remote?
